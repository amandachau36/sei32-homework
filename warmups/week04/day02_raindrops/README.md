# Pling Plang Plong

Write a program that converts a number to a string per the following rules:

If the number contains 3 as a factor, output 'Pling'.
If the number contains 5 as a factor, output 'Plang'.
If the number contains 7 as a factor, output 'Plong'.

If the number does not contain 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, simply return the
string representation of the number itself.

E.g.

The number 28 is divisible by 7, so...

```
# => "Plong"
```

The number 1755 is divisible by 3 and 5, so...

```
# => "PlingPlang"
```

The number 34 is not divisible by 3,5 or 7, so...

```
# => "34"
```
