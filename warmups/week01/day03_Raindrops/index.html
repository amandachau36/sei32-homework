  <h1>Warmup - Raindrops</h1>
  <p>Write a Javascript program that will take a number (eg 28 or 1755 or 9, etc) and output the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the number contains 3 as a factor, output 'Pling'.</li>
    <li>If the number contains 5 as a factor, output 'Plang'.</li>
    <li>If the number contains 7 as a factor, output 'Plong'.</li>
    <li>If the number does not contain 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, output the number as a string.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Examples</h3>

  <p>28 has 7 as a factor.</p>
  <p>In raindrop-speak, this would be a simple "Plong".</p>
  <p>1755 has 3 and 5 as factors.</p>
  <p>In raindrop-speak, this would be a "PlingPlang".</p>
  <p>34 has neither 3, 5 nor 7 as a factor.</p>
  <p>Raindrop-speak doesn't know what to make of that, so it just goes with the straightforward "34".</p>
